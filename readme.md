# CS to TS

## What is it?

A tool for converting CS models to TS types

## How It Works

I borrowed a variety of code from another repo and I wish I could recall where I foundi t in my google search so going to just leave this here in case it benefits others in the future.

Constants requires a list of assemblies that contain your interfaces and dtos. Run the project and in the export directory run
tsc
package then deploy the library.

Automation of course
